/**
 * Corner-stroke capture INSIDE the SystemUI process, with TWO transports.
 *
 * ── A. PRIMARY: a real gesture monitor (`InputManagerGlobal.monitorGestureInput`
 *      + `InputEventReceiver` on the main looper) ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This is the transport the MiuiBackGestureHook reference uses on this exact device.
 *
 * WHY IT REPLACES THE OLD SELF-MADE SPY VIEW (device log, 2026-10-08):
 * the module used to add its own window — type 2024 (NAVIGATION_BAR_PANEL),
 * `setTrustedOverlay()`, `inputFeatures |= INPUT_FEATURE_SPY` — and read the stroke
 * from `View.onTouchEvent`. Over the launcher that works, but with an APP in the
 * foreground the stroke died 6–22 ms after ACTION_DOWN:
 *
 *     SPY_RIGHT_DOWN side=RIGHT x=199.0 y=237.0 wh=299/299 inBox=true eligible=true
 *     SPY_RIGHT_SYSTEM_CANCEL tracking=true claimed=false                 (+9 ms)
 *
 * i.e. the input dispatcher dropped the spy window from the touch state long before
 * the diagonal claim thresholds (`inward ≥ max(1.75·slop, 14dp)`, `upward ≥
 * max(0.5·slop, 4dp)`) could be reached — which is exactly why the drawer only ever
 * opened over the launcher.
 *
 * Two hooks were previously built to chase that drop; BOTH were chasing nothing on
 * this ROM and are gone with this change:
 *   • an ACTION_DOWN gate inside the native back plugin — `EdgeBackGestureHandler`
 *     has no motion handling left on this build (R8 moved it into the plugin), and
 *   • a guard on `android.view.InputMonitor.pilferPointers()` — never called during a
 *     stroke (zero PILFER_ANY lines in the module log). There is not even a
 *     `[Gesture Monitor] edge-swipe` window in `dumpsys input`, so SystemUI's AOSP
 *     edge-back monitor is simply not the arbiter here; MiuiHome's touchable
 *     `GestureStubView` side window plus MIUI input redirection is.
 *
 * HOW THE MONITOR FIXES IT: `InputManagerService.monitorGestureInput` on this build
 * ALWAYS builds a `GestureMonitorSpyWindow` whose `InputWindowHandle.inputConfig` is
 * `SPY | DO_NOT_PILFER` (device `services.jar` →
 * com.android.server.input.InputManagerService:646-672 +
 * GestureMonitorSpyWindow.java:35; see hiddenapi/.../InputManagerGlobal.java). A
 * gesture monitor therefore keeps receiving the whole stream even while another
 * window takes the pointers — precisely what "observe first, claim later" needs.
 * (`dumpsys input` confirms the pattern: SystemUI's own `[Gesture Monitor]
 * MultiTaskSwitch` carries `DO_NOT_PILFER`, while our old plain SPY window did not.)
 *
 * The monitor's touchable region is the whole display, so the DOWN gate is a
 * screen-space corner-box test ([sideFor]) instead of a window hit test. The engine
 * is unchanged: the stream is observed, and only claimed — with `pilferPointers()` —
 * once the diagonal thresholds are met, after which the fan receives the rest of the
 * stroke as ONE continuous sequence.
 *
 * ── B. FALLBACK: the original SPY view windows ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Kept verbatim (FlymeFreeform reference hook/SystemUiCornerInputMonitor.kt :200-223
 * window params, :236-359 gesture view, :170-184 pilfer) for the case where the
 * monitor API is unavailable — no MONITOR_INPUT permission, a foreign ROM, or a
 * future MIUI change to `monitorGestureInput`. On the launcher this transport
 * already worked, so a failed monitor creation degrades instead of disabling the
 * feature. If the monitor is active the fallback windows are never added, so the two
 * can never fight over the same stroke.

     * slows from [STATE_REFRESH_MS] to [STATE_REFRESH_SCREEN_OFF_MS]: four wakeups per second
     * with two binder round-trips each is small next to a lit display, but during standby it is
     * pure waste — it keeps the SoC out of its deepest idle states and wakes system_server for
     * an answer nobody is waiting for. The screen on/off receiver and the keyguard listener do
     * the real work at the transitions; the slow tick is only a safety net, so a broadcast that
     * never arrives cannot leave the gate stuck.
